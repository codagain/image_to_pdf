# image_to_pdf
 In this repository you will find a pdf.py which uses "tkinter"(a python module) for making a GUI application which converts Images into PDFs.

 This repository also includes a pdf.exe file which is a compiled form of pdf.py 

 Image type supported: jpeg, jpg, png.
 
 All the images are taken from user and combined to form a single PDF file which is then stored in the same directory from which the images were selected.

 Modifying the pdf.py(as necessary) and compiling it into a executable or any other suitable file format on your local environment will be a best practice to utilise this repository
